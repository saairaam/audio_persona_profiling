# 🎙️ Audio Persona Profiling Dashboard

This project is an **AI-powered Gradio dashboard** that analyzes a speaker's **audio input** to determine emotional state, personality traits, fluency, acoustic features, and linguistic patterns.

It uses a multi-agent system with state-of-the-art NLP and audio models to deliver deep interpretability for audio-based personality and sentiment profiling.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎧 Upload audio files for real-time analysis
- 🔊 Acoustic Agent: MFCC, pitch, and energy extraction
- 🗣️ Lexical Agent: Transcription + Type-Token Ratio
- ⏱️ Fluency Agent: Speech rate, fillers, pause ratio
- 😊 Emotion Agent: Valence, arousal, dominance, emotion label
- 🧠 Personality Agent: Big Five personality profiling
- 📊 Interactive dashboard with:
  - Radar charts
  - Spectrogram
  - MFCC heatmap
  - Sentiment timeline
  - Metric table
- 📝 Scrollable transcript and downloadable expert summary (PDF)
- 💼 Exports CSV + dashboard images + ZIP archive

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- `whisper` for speech-to-text
- `librosa` for acoustic feature extraction
- `transformers` by Hugging Face for emotion classification
- `sklearn` for personality modeling
- `matplotlib` & `pandas` for visualization
- `gradio` for UI
- `FPDF` for expert summary PDF generation
